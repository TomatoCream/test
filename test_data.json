        "description": " <p>Inland Capital Services works closely with Singapore based Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to leverage on working capital schemes, government grants and various incentives aimed at increasing SMEs capabilities in the running of an efficient business.\u00a0 Our consultants help you fill the gaps in the breaks of your business cashflow! We are a business consulting firm that focuses on four main services in the areas of Business Financing Advisory, Property Financing Solutions, e-Marketing and a reseller of MYOB Software.</p>    <p>Over the past 5 years we have watched the beginnings of new start ups, the growth of dynamic SMEs, and the downfall of a company only to watch the business owner rise up again. We have helped companies through the tough recession, recovery of the economy and of course during the good times.</p>    <p>As we help more SMEs to grow, we ourselves are advancing as an organisation. We started with the idea of simply being a one stop solution for business owners to get working capital but as diverse business models presented themselves to us from various industries we started consulting on how an organization would be more cost effective if they could eventually reduce their long term liabilities and explore other forms of funding.</p>    <p>With the increasing number of clients who choose us and the varying queries and requests that we have been faced with daily, Inland Capital Services has morphed ourselves into being a one stop service consulting company that provide solutions in various forms to our SME business owners. Our advice is not just about the lowest interest rates but, we place an importance on helping you to grow as a more effective business owner thus coming up with our tag line, Your Growth, Our Priority. As we aid in companys\u2019 growth we have also allowed ourselves to develop consultants well-versed in different areas of financing. With thorough analysis of your company\u2019s financials we could simply restructure your business model to reduce your costs or liabilities and gain that extra advantage over your competitors or simply prepare your company to be ready to take advantage of an open and ready market.</p>    <p>\u00a0</p>    <p>\u00a0</p>  "
